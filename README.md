### 你好，Hi there 👋

I’m **Ningyuan Xu**, a researcher at the Institute of Fundamental & Frontier
Sciences, UESTC.  
My lab investigates how *micro/nano-textured surfaces* interact with liquids,
gases, and light, then leverages that knowledge to design breathable yet
water-proof meshes, stimuli-responsive coatings, and intelligent sensing
interfaces.

---

## Research Highlights
- **Adaptive Surfaces with Stimuli-Responsive Wettability**  
  *ACS Nano* (2025) – review of design principles for switchable wetting
  materials.
- **Breathable Window Screen Against High-Velocity Droplet Penetration**  
  *Small* (2025) – bilayer Janus mesh that blocks 4.5 m s⁻¹ raindrops while
  maintaining airflow.
- **Domain Generalization in Nematode Classification**  
  *Computers & Electronics in Agriculture* (2023) – lightweight CNN with
  12 % higher cross-domain accuracy.

*Full list on the [Publications](/publications) page.*
