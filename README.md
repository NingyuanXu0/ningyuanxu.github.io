### 你好，Hi there 👋

I’m **Ningyuan Xu**, a researcher assistant at the Institute of Fundamental and Frontier
Sciences, UESTC.  

Currently, I am studying in a cooperative undergraduate program between University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and the University of Glasgow, and I am expected to obtain a bachelor's degree in 2026. My undergraduate major was communication work. Currently, I am engaged in research related to surface and interface science at the Center for Materials Surface Science (CMSS) of the Institute of Fundamental and Frontier.
